    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
        <li>Use a large roasting pan on medium-high heat to sear the brisket (fat-side down) until browned. About 3 min per side</li>
        <li>Place onion slices into the bottom of the same roasting pan; pour 1 can beef broth, 1 can French onion soup, and 1 can beer over onions. Lay brisket on top; pour remaining beef broth, French onion soup, and beer over brisket. Cover the roasting pan with a lid. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Let brisket stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove brisket from the roasting pan and wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Pour pan juices and onion into a food storage container and cover tightly with a lid. Refrigerate brisket and pan juices, 8 hours to overnight. </li>
        <li>The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour pan juices and onion into a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li>Unwrap brisket, cut away any visible fat, and slice thinly across the grain of the meat. Place brisket slices into pan juices. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pan juices are thickened and meat is hot, about 45 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
